            <h2>Tomato</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Tomatoes prefer warm weather with optimal temperatures between 20°C to 25°C. They require full sunlight for at least 6-8 hours a day.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> Approximately 150-200 grams per hectare.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The soil should be well-drained and rich in organic matter. It needs to be plowed thoroughly and leveled. The ideal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.0.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Seeds are sown in seedbeds or trays and then transplanted to the main field after 4-6 weeks. Plant spacing should be around 60-75 cm between rows and 45-60 cm between plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> A balanced fertilizer regime is essential. Apply N:P:K (Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium) in the ratio of 50:50:50 kg/ha. Additional nitrogen may be applied during the growing period. Organic manure or compost should also be incorporated into the soil.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Tomatoes require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and fruiting. Irrigate regularly to keep the soil evenly moist but avoid waterlogging, which can lead to root diseases.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include blight, leaf spot, and bacterial wilt. Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and apply appropriate fungicides and insecticides as needed. Ensure proper spacing and avoid overhead irrigation to minimize disease spread.</p>
