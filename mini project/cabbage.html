            <h2>Green Cabbage</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Prefers a cool climate with optimal temperatures between 15°C to 21°C.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> Approximately 400-500 grams per hectare.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The soil should be well-drained and loamy. It needs to be plowed thoroughly and enriched with organic matter or compost. The ideal soil pH is between 6.0 and 6.5.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Seeds are sown in seedbeds and then transplanted to the main field after 4-6 weeks. Plant spacing should be around 45-60 cm between rows and 30-45 cm between plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> A balanced fertilizer regime is necessary. A typical recommendation is to apply N:P:K (Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium) in the ratio of 60:40:40 kg/ha. Additional nitrogen may be applied during the growing period.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Cabbage requires consistent moisture. Irrigate regularly to keep the soil evenly moist, particularly during head formation. Avoid waterlogging which can lead to root diseases.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include black rot, downy mildew, and clubroot. Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and apply appropriate fungicides as needed. Ensure proper spacing and avoid overhead irrigation to minimize disease spread.</p>
