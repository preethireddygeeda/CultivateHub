            <h2>Sugarcane</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Sugarcane thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C. It requires a long, warm growing season with plenty of sunlight and moderate to high rainfall.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> The seed requirement for sugarcane is about 8-10 tonnes per hectare. Healthy and disease-free setts (stem cuttings) with 2-3 buds each are used for planting.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The land should be plowed deeply and thoroughly to a depth of 25-30 cm. It should be leveled and well-drained. Adding organic matter or compost can improve soil fertility and structure.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Sugarcane is typically planted in rows. Setts are planted either in furrows or trenches at a spacing of 90-150 cm between rows and 30-45 cm between setts. The planting depth is around 10-15 cm.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Sugarcane is a heavy feeder and requires a balanced application of nutrients. The typical fertilizer recommendation is 150-200 kg of nitrogen, 60-80 kg of phosphorus, and 60-80 kg of potassium per hectare. Additional micronutrients may be required based on soil tests.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Sugarcane requires a consistent and adequate water supply. It needs about 1500-2500 mm of water during the growing season. Irrigation should be scheduled based on the crop's growth stage and soil moisture levels. Avoid waterlogging, as it can harm the crop.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common sugarcane diseases include red rot, smut, and leaf scald. Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and apply appropriate fungicides as needed. Maintain field hygiene and proper spacing to reduce disease incidence.</p>
