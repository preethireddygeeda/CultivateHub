            <h2>Potato</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Potatoes grow best in cool climates. The ideal temperature range for growth is between 15°C to 20°C. Higher temperatures can affect tuber formation.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> About 2-2.5 tons of seed potatoes are required per hectare. Use certified, disease-free seed tubers for best results.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> Potatoes require well-drained, loose, and fertile soil. Plow the land thoroughly to a depth of 20-25 cm and add organic matter or compost to improve soil structure. The soil pH should be between 5.0 and 6.5.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant seed potatoes in rows spaced 60-75 cm apart with 20-30 cm between plants in a row. Plant the tubers 10-15 cm deep. Planting time varies by region but is generally done in early spring or fall.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer such as N:P:K (Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium) in the ratio of 120:60:100 kg/ha. Additional nitrogen may be applied during the growing period to promote healthy foliage.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Potatoes require regular and consistent watering, especially during tuber formation. Avoid overwatering and waterlogging, which can lead to diseases. Drip irrigation or furrow irrigation is recommended.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include late blight, early blight, and black scurf. Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and apply appropriate fungicides. Ensure proper spacing and avoid overhead irrigation to reduce disease incidence.</p>
