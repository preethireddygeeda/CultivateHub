            <h2>Mango</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Mangoes thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. They require a temperature range of 24°C to 30°C and do not tolerate frost. Adequate sunlight and a dry season are essential for fruit development.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> Mangoes are typically propagated through grafting rather than seeds. However, if seeds are used, select healthy, disease-free seeds from vigorous trees.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The land should be well-drained with good aeration. Deep plowing and harrowing are necessary to remove weeds and incorporate organic matter. The ideal soil pH is between 5.5 and 7.5.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Plant mango saplings in pits of 1m x 1m x 1m size filled with a mixture of soil and organic manure. The spacing should be about 10m x 10m for regular varieties. Ensure the graft union is above the soil level.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced dose of N:P:K (Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium) in the ratio of 90:90:90 grams per tree during the first year, increasing the dose as the tree matures. Organic manure and micronutrients are also beneficial.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Mango trees require regular watering during the first 3-4 years after planting. Once established, they need watering during the flowering and fruiting periods. Avoid waterlogging and ensure proper drainage.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include powdery mildew, anthracnose, and bacterial canker. Use disease-resistant varieties, apply fungicides and bactericides as necessary, and practice good orchard hygiene. Regular pruning helps in air circulation and disease control.</p>
