            <h2>Wheat</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Wheat thrives in cool and dry climates. The ideal temperature for wheat growth is between 10°C to 25°C. It requires well-distributed rainfall of 500-1000 mm during its growing season.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> The seed rate is about 100-125 kg per hectare for normal sowing and 125-150 kg per hectare for late sowing.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The land should be plowed thoroughly and leveled. It is essential to have a well-prepared seedbed that is free from weeds and has good tilth. Application of organic matter or compost helps in improving soil fertility.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Sowing time varies with the region. In India, wheat is generally sown from late October to December. Seeds are sown at a depth of 4-5 cm with a spacing of 20-22.5 cm between rows.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced dose of N:P:K fertilizers. A typical recommendation is 120 kg of Nitrogen, 60 kg of Phosphorus, and 40 kg of Potassium per hectare. Nitrogen is usually applied in two or three splits.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Wheat requires about 4-6 irrigations depending on the soil type and weather conditions. Critical stages for irrigation are crown root initiation, tillering, jointing, heading, and grain filling.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common wheat diseases include rusts, smuts, and powdery mildew. Use resistant varieties, follow crop rotation, and apply fungicides as necessary. Proper field sanitation and timely sowing help in managing diseases.</p>
