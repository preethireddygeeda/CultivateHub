            <h2>Coffee</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Coffee thrives in tropical climates with temperatures ranging between 15°C to 24°C. It requires a high altitude of 600-2000 meters above sea level and prefers areas with high humidity and well-distributed rainfall.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> High-quality seeds are essential. Typically, 1 kilogram of seeds is required per hectare.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> The land should be cleared of weeds and debris. Deep plowing is necessary to loosen the soil. Coffee plants prefer well-drained, fertile soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0 to 6.5.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Seeds are usually sown in nurseries and transplanted to the main field when they are 6-12 months old. The recommended spacing is 2-3 meters between rows and 1.5-2 meters between plants.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Coffee plants require a balanced supply of nutrients. A typical recommendation is to apply N:P:K (Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium) in the ratio of 60:30:60 kg/ha. Organic manure and compost can also be used to enhance soil fertility.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry periods. Drip irrigation is recommended to provide a consistent supply of moisture and to prevent waterlogging.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include coffee leaf rust, coffee berry disease, and root rot. Use disease-resistant varieties, practice proper spacing to improve air circulation, and apply appropriate fungicides as needed. Regular monitoring and good agricultural practices are essential to manage pests and diseases effectively.</p>
