            <h2>Grapes</h2>
            <p><strong>Climate:</strong> Grapes thrive in a warm, dry climate. Ideal temperatures range between 15°C to 30°C. They require a long growing season and plenty of sunlight.</p>
            <p><strong>Seed Requirement:</strong> Generally, grapes are propagated through cuttings rather than seeds. If seeds are used, they require stratification and take longer to mature.</p>
            <p><strong>Land Preparation:</strong> Grapes require well-drained sandy loam soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5. The land should be plowed and harrowed to fine tilth. Organic matter such as compost should be incorporated into the soil.</p>
            <p><strong>Planting:</strong> Planting is done during the dormant season. Cuttings or grafted vines are planted in prepared pits or trenches. Spacing varies with the variety and training system but generally ranges from 1.8 to 3 meters apart in rows and 2.4 to 3.6 meters between rows.</p>
            <p><strong>Fertilizers:</strong> Apply a balanced fertilizer based on soil tests. A common recommendation is N:P:K in the ratio of 60:40:40 kg/ha. Micronutrients such as zinc and iron may also be necessary. Fertilization is done in stages, starting before planting and continuing through the growing season.</p>
            <p><strong>Water Supply:</strong> Regular irrigation is crucial, especially during dry periods. Drip irrigation is preferred to maintain consistent moisture levels without waterlogging. Watering frequency depends on the soil type and weather conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Disease Management:</strong> Common diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, and botrytis bunch rot. Use resistant varieties, practice good canopy management for air circulation, and apply appropriate fungicides. Regular monitoring and early intervention are key to disease control.</p>
